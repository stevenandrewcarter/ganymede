Productionize Jupyter Notebooks by providing a toolchain for extracting code cells and updating them to be used as a 
library instead. Think of Ruby On Rails style development that allows existing notebooks to be converted.

The plan is to convert the notebook into something that can be managed by a workflow, since most models in production
will generally use that approach. This approach is an opinionated approach to getting a notebook into production. 

## Scratch Ideas

* Extract code blocks and convert them into libraries, but update the existing notebook to use the new library
* Extract code blocks and convert them into libraries, but leave the original notebook unchanged
